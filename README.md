--Mohamed Tareq--
Made the bus schema, modified the front-end form for adding a bus but still not specific to admin, allowed the user to book a bus after the admin has added one.
Issues still exist for the APIs, indicating as they doesn't exist.

Added the functionalities of adding and deleting bus by providing their name, route, seats, and schedule.
made the schema and connected it to the back-end with express.js, It was well organised and handled routing efficiently.
conncted the front-end with the back-end using axios along with try-catch statements and logic handling for edge cases.
completely fixed the API endpoints problem by clearly understanding the routing techniques and proper handling for each endpoint.
next steps are modifying the UI and adding more functionalities to the back-end by extending the schema of the bus and allowing the users
to actually book and cancel the existing buses that the admin has added recently.
